# Multiple Choice Javascript Game

This was a personal Javascript project. I created this multiple choice game with a few goals in mind. I wanted it to load the questions in random order each time, confirm weather or not the choice is correct or incorrect when clicked, have a seamless animation between questions, and show the total of correct answers once finished.
